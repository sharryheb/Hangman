# Hankman! 

A "Tom Hanks" spin on the classic Hangman game. Try to guess the name of the Tom Hanks movie before you run out of guesses.

See the app here: https://sharryheb.github.io/Hangman/

## Instructions
1. Type a letter to see if it is in the phrase to guess.
2. Letters already used will be displayed, as will the number of guesses you have remaining.
3. You can guess wrong 10 times before you lose the game.
4. When you either guess the movie title correctly, or run out of guesses, the answer will show in the form of a video clip.
5. Good luck!
